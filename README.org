#+TITLE: Homebrew Tap for the Marmaduke Chromium builds

If you're looking for a macOS build of the latest stable Chromium
which includes modern video codecs such as H.264, then the marmaduke
builds as advertised on [[https://chromium.woolyss.com/#mac][Woolyss]] are your best bet.

This homebrew tap was created for the easy installation of
above-mentioned builds.

To install do:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew tap SheinH/marmaduke-chromium
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium
#+END_SRC

If you prefer the build without google sync and widevine (which you do
need to play for example Netflix), then rather install:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium-nosync
#+END_SRC

An ungoogled chromium build with widevine support are also available:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium-ungoogled
#+END_SRC

Dev versions are also available for both sync and nosync:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium-dev
brew cask install marmaduke-chromium-dev-nosync
#+END_SRC

From here on, do the following to upgrade when a new build becomes
available:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew update
brew cask upgrade marmaduke-chromium
#+END_SRC
